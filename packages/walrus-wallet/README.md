   - Users can submit digital certificates received via Walrus Wallet through QR codes for verification by an authenticator.
   - Example: Instantly verifying the validity of a concert ticket through QR code scanning.

1. Automated Access Control
   - QR codes are scanned at entry points such as buildings, event venues, or clubs to verify access.
   - Example: Managing hotel check-ins, accessing secure areas, or controlling entry to co-working spaces.

1. Team & Enterprise Access (Shared Accounts and Membership Authentication)
   - In team accounts or enterprise SaaS services, QR codes are used to authenticate and manage access for members.
